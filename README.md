#Theme : Audio dubbing for Youtube videos

#We aim to solve the problem by creating a  youtube audio translation platform using AWS server-less architecture. The output will be a downloaded video with the audio track modified in the language of one's choice.

#Once the url of the YouTube video is given as the input in the app, it can be translated into any language especially documentaries and monologues as it becomes easier when a single person is speaking rather than when a group of people are talking together.

#Speech to speech translation is being implemented using libraries in react and python. Url of the video is being given so initially the video need not be downloaded, but since the process is done all together, the output is a downloaded video.

#Speech to speech translation is being implemented using Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, Amazon Polly, Lambda. Url of the video is being given so initially the video need not be downloaded, but since the process is done all together, the output is a downloaded video.

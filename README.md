#Theme : Audio dubbing for Youtube videos

#We aim to solve the problem by creating a  youtube audio translation platform using AWS server-less architecture. The output will be a downloaded video with the audio track modified in the language of one's choice.

#Once the url of the YouTube video is given as the input in the app, it can be translated into any language especially documentaries and monologues as it becomes easier when a single person is speaking rather than when a group of people are talking together.
